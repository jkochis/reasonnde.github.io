    <p>Many of health care reform’s regulations depend on business size, which is often defined by the number of
        full-time equivalent (FTE) employees a company has. To calculate your FTEs <a
                href="https://www.aflac.com/health-care-reform/decision-tool/default.aspx">try our calculator</a> or use
        this equation: Number of hours
        worked by your part-time employees per-month, divided by 120, plus the number of full-time (at least 30 hour per
        week) employees you have. To get a yearly number, the FTEs for 12 calendar months are averaged.</p>

            <p>Though we can’t predict what else will come in years ahead, what we do know is that the cost of health
                care continues to increase. With higher premiums and deductibles, many employers are looking for ways to
                reduce costs. One solution is voluntary benefits.</p>
            <p>Voluntary insurance includes supplemental life, disability, critical illness, hospital, accident, cancer
                insurance and many more. These benefits pay cash to help cover bills and out-of-pocket costs not covered
                by major medical insurance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 4 in 5 employees (79 percent) see a growing need for voluntary insurance compared to last
                    year. And of those, 60 percent say it’s because of rising medical costs.
                </li>
                <li>Employees who were offered voluntary benefits at work reported higher levels of satisfaction with
                    their jobs and their benefits.
                </li>
                <li>Employees who are enrolled in voluntary benefits at work are also more likely to say they’re
                    prepared for out-of-pocket expenses not covered by major medical/health insurance.

            <p>Health insurance benefits are one of the top ways to attract and retain employees. Because your company
                has 50 or more full-time equivalent employees, there are several details you’ll need to know about
                offering health insurance coverage to your employees.</p>
            <p><strong>Benefits requirements</strong>:</p>
            <p>Major medical insurance must be offered to all <strong>full-time employees and dependents</strong>.
                <strong>This includes employees who</strong> work 30 hours of service or more per week and their
                dependents up to age 26. Hours of
                service include hours worked and hours that an employee is paid but does not work, such as vacation,
                holiday, illness or disability, jury duty and military duty. <em>Health care reform doesn’t require
                    employers to offer coverage to spouses ofemployees or part-time employees</em>.</p>
            <p>The coverage must also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be affordable</strong>: The employee portion of the premium for self-only coverage should be
                    less
                    than 9.5 percent of the employee’s W-2 income.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Meet minimum value requirements</strong>: The health plan should covers at least 60 percent
                    of
                    the total allowed cost of benefits.
                </li>
            </ul>

                benefits and coverage under the applicable plan or coverage. This requirement applies to group health
                plans (both insured and self-insured) and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health
                insurance coverage.</p>
            <p><strong>Submit required reporting</strong>: Your company will need to consider the following reporting:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">IRS reporting of employer-sponsored health care coverage</a> (including statements to

                part-time employees,
                you’re still responsible for keeping detailed records of employment status and hours worked. Tracking

            <p>Trigger 1 (at least one of these is true for your company):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your company doesn’t offer health care coverage to 70 percent of all full-time employees and their
                    dependent children in 2015 and 95 percent in 2016.
                </li>
                <li>Your company offers coverage that isn’t considered affordable.</li>
                <li>Your company offers coverage that doesn’t meet minimum value standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Trigger 2: At least one employee or their dependent child receives a subsidy through a federal or state
                insurance exchange to help offset the cost of purchasing health care coverage.</p>
            <p>Your business may be penalized in one of two ways based on whether your company chooses not to offer
                health care coverage at all or offers noncompliant coverage. The penalty for not offering health
                coverage at all is sometimes considered more severe. The penalty for offering coverage that isn’t
                compliant may be less so; however, it can be substantial nonetheless. Keeping in mind intangible factors
                such as the benefits of offering employees health care coverage, including improved job satisfaction,
                loyalty and morale, potential penalties are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$2,000 penalty per full-time employee - Think of this as the sledgehammer penalty: If an employer
                    doesn’t
                    offer any type of health care coverage to substantially all of its full-time employees and their
                    dependents, the employer is penalized a fee of $2,000 for each of its full-time employees, excluding
                    the
                    first 30, if at least one of their full-time employees qualifies for and receives a premium subsidy
                    in
                    the individual insurance market through a federal or state exchange.
                </li>
                <li>$3,000 penalty per full-time employee or dependent receiving a subsidy - Think of this as the tack
                    hammer
                    penalty: If an employer offers coverage that is either unaffordable or doesn’t meet minimum value
                    requirements, the employer is penalized $3,000 only for each full-time employee or dependent who
                    purchases health care coverage in the individual market through a federal or state exchange and
                    receives
                    a premium subsidy.

                Tax (Excise tax on high-cost health plans)</h5>
            <p>The Cadillac Tax is equivalent to 40 percent of
                the cost of health coverage beyond a certain threshold, depending on the type of plan. Since it isn’t
                scheduled to take effect until 2020 and regulations may evolve before it is implemented, employers do
                not need to make changes to their policies in anticipation of the tax just yet. It’s important to wait
                for further guidance as 2020 draws near – including the tax threshold amounts and other implementation
                details. Learn more:</p>

            <p>Exchanges can do some of the heavy lifting that usually accompanies workplace benefits, such
                as paperwork or coordinating between multiple carriers, which can help businesses save on administrative
                costs. Private exchanges, like Everwell powered by Aflac, can offer multiple options and a variety of
                voluntary products, including vision, dental, disability, accident and more. <a href="#">Learn more</a>.

                benefits</h5>
            <p>Though we can’t predict what else will come in years ahead, what we do know is that the cost of health
                care continues to increase. With higher premiums and deductibles, many employers are looking for ways to
                reduce costs. One solution is voluntary benefits.</p>
            <p>Voluntary insurance includes supplemental life, disability, critical illness, hospital, accident, cancer
                insurance and many more. These benefits pay cash to help cover bills and out-of-pocket costs not covered
                by major medical insurance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 4 in 5 employees (79 percent) see a growing need for voluntary insurance compared to last
                    year. And of those, 60 percent say it’s because of rising medical costs.
                </li>
                <li>Employees who were offered voluntary benefits at work reported higher levels of satisfaction with
                    their jobs and their benefits.
                </li>
                <li>Employees who are enrolled in voluntary benefits at work are also more likely to say they’re
                    prepared for out-of-pocket expenses not covered by major medical/health insurance.
