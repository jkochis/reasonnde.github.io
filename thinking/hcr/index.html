    <p>Many of health care reform’s regulations depend on business size, which is often defined by the number of
        full-time equivalent (FTE) employees a company has. To calculate your FTEs <a
                href="https://www.aflac.com/health-care-reform/decision-tool/default.aspx">try our calculator</a> or use
        this equation: Number of hours
        worked by your part-time employees per-month, divided by 120, plus the number of full-time (at least 30 hour per
        week) employees you have. To get a yearly number, the FTEs for 12 calendar months are averaged.</p>

            <p>Health insurance benefits are one of the top ways to attract and retain employees. Because your company
                has 50 or
                more full-time equivalent employees, there are several details you’ll need to know about offering health
                insurance coverage to your employees.</p>
            <p>Benefits requirements:</p>
            <p>Major medical insurance must be offered to all full-time employees and dependents. This includes
                employees who
                work 30 hours of service or more per week and their dependents up to age 26. Hours of service include
                hours
                worked and hours that an employee is paid but does not work, such as vacation, holiday, illness or
                disability,
                jury duty and military duty. Health care reform doesn’t require employers to offer coverage to spouses
                of
                employees or part-time employees.</p>
            <p>The coverage must also:</p>
            <p><strong>Be affordable</strong>: The employee portion of the premium for self-only coverage should be less than 9.5 percent
                of the
                employee’s W-2 income.</p>
            <p><strong>Meet minimum value requirements</strong>: The health plan should covers at least 60 percent of the total allowed
                cost of
                benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>Required communication</strong>: Employers are required to provide notice about health insurance marketplaces to

        <!--<p>Aflac offers discounts on reporting assistance to group accounts. Ask your Aflac agent for details.</p>-->
        <!--<p>Keep track. Though your company may not be required to offer compliant coverage to part-time employees,-->
            <!--you’re-->
            <!--still responsible for keeping detailed records of employment status and hours worked. Tracking involves-->
