                <li>Include essential health benefits.</li>

The SBC must provide an accurate description of the benefits and coverage under the applicable plan or coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep track.</strong> Employers are responsible for keeping detailed records of employment status and hours worked by their employees.

                <strong>The Cadillac tax</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>The Cadillac Tax is equivalent to 40 percent of the cost of health coverage beyond a certain threshold, depending on the type of plan. Since it isn’t scheduled to take effect until 2020 and regulations may evolve before it is implemented, employers do not need to make changes to their policies in anticipation of the tax just yet. It’s important to wait for further guidance as 2020 draws near – including the tax threshold amounts and other implementation details.</p>

            <p><strong>Aflac is not major medical insurance.</strong> Aflac insurance policies don’t replace comprehensive health insurance coverage. These benefits are considered HIPAA excepted benefits, which are excluded from most of the ACA’s market reforms. Because of this, having voluntary benefits options is a smart way for businesses to enhance their employee benefits packages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aflac is for specified injuries, illnesses or disabilities.</strong> For example: a broken arm, heart attack or hospital stay. Relevant policies include supplemental life, disability, critical illness, hospital, accident, cancer insurance and much more. These benefits pay cash to help cover bills and out-of-pocket costs not covered by major medical insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Aflac helps cover out-of-pocket costs that major medical insurance was never designed to cover.</strong> Even with major medical insurance, potential out-of-pocket costs associated with illness or injury can be considerably high. Aflac cash benefits can be used for everyday living expenses such as rent/monthly mortgage, utilities, groceries or child care, or to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses. Aflac pays cash benefits when policyholders are sick or hurt to use however they want so they can focus on recovery, not financial stress.</li>

            <p>The Cadillac Tax is equivalent to 40 percent of the cost of health coverage beyond a certain threshold, depending on the type of plan. Since it isn’t scheduled to take effect until 2020 and regulations may evolve before it is implemented, employers do not need to make changes to their policies in anticipation of the tax just yet. It’s important to wait for further guidance as 2020 draws near – including the tax threshold amounts and other implementation details.</p>
